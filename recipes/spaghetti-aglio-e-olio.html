    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This spaghetti is a staple in my repitoire. Feel free to play around with the heat levels until you find 
        the right amount of spice for you. I always go back for seconds when this is the main dish. Best eaten
        fresh although it can be enjoyed after being in the fridge.
